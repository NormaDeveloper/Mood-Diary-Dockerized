# Mood-Diary

In this application I made code for a server and a frontend that solves the task we describe you
below. 

I used node.js to create the backend and react in the frontend. 


## Description

This is a little mood diary web-page. In this diary you can post entries with a text and a mood.
The mood status can be “I’m happy”, “I’m angry”, “I’m sad”.
You are able to add new entries and persist them in the backend (node), edit your
entries, and check the results of the team.

There is no need for a login, as name simply put your name statically in the code =)

If you click on the see results button (bar diagram icon), then you'll open a modal view with a bar
chart with the averages of the team mood for your team that day.

Create and edit entries are validated. Both fields are required and the description has
a limit of 100 characters.
